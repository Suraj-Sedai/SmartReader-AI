# SmartReader-AI
Knowledge Assistant App
An AI-powered app that allows users to upload text or documents and trains a model to answer questions based on the provided input. The app leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to deliver accurate and context-aware responses. Built with Django for the backend, React for the frontend, and TensorFlow for training and deploying models, this project is a step towards making information retrieval smarter and more accessible.
